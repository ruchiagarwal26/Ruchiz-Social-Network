## Overview:

This project is build on Express and Mongoose. I have created a Social Netwrork site that is interactive with Insomnia (front end) and Mongo DB (back end). 

```
* When the server is started, RUCHIZ-SOCIAL-NETWORK database is created on MongoDB

* the DB has empty tables : Users and Thoughts

* when we create Users, friends, thoughts or reactions using POST request the corresponding documents are created in MongoDB

* when we want to query these documents we can run GET command in insomnia for any of the above features

* to update any User or Thought, PUT call can be made against MongoDB through insomnia

* Any user, corresponding thought, specific thought, reaction and friend can be deleted by making DELETE call in insomnia on MongoDB

* Thus, a user has access to all the functionalities that they need to access data in MongoDB using API calls in insomnia

```
